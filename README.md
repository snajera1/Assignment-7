## Assignment 7

This program is an implementation of several functions used to generate random arrays of a given length, read and write arrays to and from text files,
and sort arrays through the bubble sort algorithm. The program begins by giving the user the choice to generate a random array and write it to a file,
get an array from a file and sort it before writing it to another file, or quitting, based on a choice of inputs. It loops until the user decides to quit.
